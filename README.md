# 911 Call Analysis ðŸ“ž

A data analysis project to explore and visualize trends in 911 emergency call data, providing actionable insights for better resource management and decision-making.

# Features
+ **Temporal Analysis:** Examines call patterns over time to identify peak hours and days for emergencies.
+ **Reason Categorization:** Analyzes the most frequent causes for 911 calls (e.g., medical, traffic, fire).
+ **Geospatial Trends:** Highlights areas with high call volumes to understand geographical distribution.
+ **Visual Insights:** Employs data visualization to present findings effectively.

# Dataset
The analysis is based on a dataset containing details of 911 calls, including:

+ **Time:** Timestamps of the calls.
+ **Location:** Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
+ **Reason:**  The primary reason for the emergency call (e.g., medical, traffic).
+ **Additional Details:** Other metadata about the calls.


# Workflow

+ **Data Preprocessing:**

  Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.
  Cleaned and formatted data, handling missing or inconsistent values.

+ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  Performed analysis on call reasons, time, and location.
  Identified patterns and trends in the data.

+ **Visualization:**

  Used libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create:
  + Time-based trend graphs.
  + Heatmaps for geospatial analysis.
  + Bar charts for call reason distribution.

# Results:

Generated insights into the busiest times and locations for 911 calls.
Identified the most common types of emergencies.

# Conclusions Drawn
+ Emergency calls peak during specific hours and weekdays, indicating predictable patterns in call volume.
+ Medical emergencies are the most common, followed by traffic-related incidents.
+ Certain geographical locations consistently experience higher call volumes, suggesting a need for focused resource allocation.
+ Visualizing and analyzing 911 call data can support emergency services in optimizing response strategies and improving overall efficiency.
